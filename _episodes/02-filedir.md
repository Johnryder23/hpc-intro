teaching: 30
exercises: 10
questions:
- "How can I move around the cluster filesystem"
- "How can I see what files and directories I have?"
- "How can I make new files and directories."
objectives:
- "Create, edit, manipulate and remove files from command line"
- "Translate an absolute path into a relative path and vice versa."
- "Use options and arguments to change the behaviour of a shell command."
- "Demonstrate the use of tab completion and explain its advantages."
keypoints:
- "The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk."
- "Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders)."
- "Directories can also store other directories, which then form a directory tree."
- "`cd [path]` changes the current working directory."
- "`ls [path]` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory."
- "`pwd` prints the user's current working directory."
- "`/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system."
- "Most commands take options (flags) that begin with a `-`."
- "A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location."
- "An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system."
- "Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows."
- "`..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'."

The part of the operating system responsible for managing files and directories
is called the **file system**.
It organizes our data into files,
which hold information,
and directories (also called 'folders'),
which hold files or other directories.

The NeSI filesystem looks something like this:

![The file system is made up of a root directory that contains sub-directories
titled home, nesi, and system files](../fig/NesiFiletree.svg)

Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
To start exploring them, we'll go to our open shell window.

First, let's find out where we are by running a command called `pwd`
(which stands for 'print working directory'). Directories are like *places* â€” at any time
while we are using the shell, we are in exactly one place called
our **current working directory**.
Commands mostly read and write files in the
current working directory, i.e. 'here', so knowing where you are before running
a command is important.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/home/<username>
```
Those using Jupyter will see something like this instead:
```
/home/<username>/.jupyter/jobs/<jupyter-jobid>
```
{: .output}

> ## Default directory
>
> We will assume that your `pwd` command returns your user's home directory (`/home/` followed by your username).
> If `pwd` returns something different, you will need to navigate to your home directory by running the command `cd`
{: .callout}

To understand what a 'home directory' is,
let's have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized.

At the top is the **root directory**
that holds all the files in a filesystem.
We refer to it using a slash character, `/`, on its own;
this character is the leading slash in `/home/<username>`.

We know that our current working directory `/home/<username>` is stored inside `/home`
because `/home` is the first part of its name.
Similarly,
we know that `/home` is stored inside the root directory `/`
because its name begins with `/`.

In the NeSI file system you will have access to several different locations.

## Listing the contents of directories

As you may now see, using a bash shell is strongly dependent on the idea that
your files are organized in a hierarchical file system.
Organizing things hierarchically in this way helps us keep track of our work:
it's possible to put hundreds of files in our home directory,
just as it's possible to pile hundreds of printed papers on our desk,
but it's a self-defeating strategy.

The command to prints the names of the files and directories is `ls` followed by the desired directories path. 
However, `ls` can be run without an argument, in which case it will list the contents of the directory you 
are currently located in.

We will now list the contents of the `project` directory we we will be working from. We can
use the following command to do this:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls /nesi/project/nesi99991
```
{: .language-bash}

```
 ernz2021  ML20210329  ML20210928  resbaz2021  snakemake20210914
```

You should see a directory called `resbaz2021`, and possibly several other directories. For the purposes of this workshop you will be working within `/nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021`

{: .callout}

## Moving about

The command to **c**hange **d**irectory is `cd` followed by a
directory name to change our working directory.
The `cd` command is akin to double clicking a folder in a graphical interface to get into a folder.

We will now move into the`project` directory we saw above. We can
use the following of commands to get there:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cd /nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021
```
{: .language-bash}

You will notice that `cd` doesn't print anything. This is normal. Many shell commands will not output anything to the screen when successfully executed.
But if we run `pwd` after it, we can see that we are now
in `/nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021`.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021
```
{: .output}

> ## Two More Shortcuts

## Creating files

As previously mentioned, it is general useful to organise your work in a hierarchical file structure to make managing and finding files easier. It is also is especially important when working within a shared directory with colleagues, such as a project, to minimise the chance of accidentally effecting your colleagues work. So for this workshop you will each make a directory using the `mkdir` command within the workshops directory for you to personally work from.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} mkdir <username>
```
{: .language-bash}

## General Syntax of a Shell Command

Now that you have all created your own directory to work from lets use the `ls` command to list contents of `/nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021` again.

We have previously used Shell commands with arguments, however, this time we will also use what are known as **options**, **flags** or **switches**, which is part of the general syntax of not just `ls` but all Shell commands

Consider the command below as a general example of a command,
which we will dissect into its component parts:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls -l /nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021
```
{: .language-bash}

`ls` is the **command**, with an **option** `-l` and an
**argument** `/nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021`.
Options, either start with a single dash (`-`) or two dashes (`--`), and they change the behavior of a command.
Often options will have a short and long format e.g. `-a` and `--all`
[Arguments] tell the command what to operate on (e.g. files and directories).

When you run this command you should see something like this output (though likely with more lines):

```
total 1
-rw-r-----+ 1 cwal219 nesi99991  460 Nov 18 17:03 array_sum.r
drwxrws---+ 2 usr123  nesi99991 4096 Nov 15 09:01 usr123
drwxrws---+ 2 usr345  nesi99991 4096 Nov 15 09:01 usr345
```
{: .output}

Here we can see that the `-l` option has used what is know as the "long listing format",
and has listed all the files in alphanumeric order, which can make finding a specific file easier.
It also includes information about thefile size, time of its last modification, and permission and ownership information.

Sometimes options and arguments are referred to as **parameters**.
A command can be called with more than one option and more than one argument, but a
command doesn't always require an argument or an option.

Each part is separated by spaces: if you omit the space
between `ls` and `-l` the shell will look for a command called `ls-l`, which
doesn't exist. Also, capitalization can be important.
For example, `ls -s` will display the size of files and directories alongside the names,
while `ls -S` will sort the files and directories by size.

Another userful option for `ls` is the `-a` option, lets try using this option together with the -l option:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls -la
```
{: .language-bash}

```
total 1
drwxrws---+  4 usr001  nesi99991   4096 Nov 15 09:00 .
drwxrws---+ 12 root    nesi99991 262144 Nov 15 09:23 ..
-rw-r-----+  1 cwal219 nesi99991    460 Nov 18 17:03 array_sum.r
drwxrws---+  2 usr123  nesi99991   4096 Nov 15 09:01 usr123
drwxrws---+  2 usr345  nesi99991   4096 Nov 15 09:01 usr345
```
{: .output}

You might notice that we now have two extra lines for directories `.` and `..`. These are hidden directories which the `-a` option has been used to reveal, you can create a hidden directories or files by beggining their filenames with a `.`.

These two specific hiddent directories are special as they will exist hidden inside every directory, with the `.` hidden directory reprenting your current directory and the `..` hidden directory reprenting the **parent** directory above your current directory.

{: .challenge}

## Relative paths

You may have noticed in the last command we did not specify an argument for the directory path.
Until now, when specifying directory names, or even a directory path (as above),
we have been using what are know **absolute paths**, which work no matter where you are currently located on the machine
since it specifies the full path from the top level root directory.
When you use a relative path with a command
like `ls` or `cd`, it tries to find that location from where we are,
rather than from the root of the file system.
In the previous command, since we did not specify an **absolute path** it ran the command on the relative path from our current directory
(implcitly using the `.` hidden directory), and so listed the contents of our current directory.

To specify the **absolute path** to a directory it is necessary to
use its entire path from the root directory, which is indicated by a
leading slash. The leading `/` tells the computer to follow the path from
the root of the file system, so it always refers to exactly one directory,
no matter where we are when we run the command.

The simplest method of moving up to the parent directory is to use the previously mentioned hidden `..` directory:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cd ..
```
{: .language-bash}

`..` is a special directory name meaning
"the directory containing this one",
or more succinctly,
the **parent** of the current directory.
Sure enough,
if we run `pwd` after running `cd ..`, we're back in `/nesi/project/nesi99991`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} pwd
```
{: .language-bash}

```
/nesi/project/nesi99991
```
{: .output}

Depending on your default options,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or
directory.

Let's try moving to your personal directory from before. Last time we used `cd`, we used
the absolute path from the root, but it is often easier to use the relative path.

## Tab completion

Sometime file paths can also be very long, making typing out the path tedious.
One neat trick you can use to save yourself time is to use something called **tab completion**.
If you start typing the path in a command and their is only one possible match,
if you hit tab the path will autocomplete (until there are more than one possible matches).

For example, if you type:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cd res
```
{: .language-bash}

and then press <kbd>Tab</kbd> (the tab key on your keyboard),
the shell automatically completes the directory name for you (since there is only one possible match):

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cd resbaz2021/
```
{: .language-bash}

However, that command would only take you `/nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021`.
You want to move to your personal working diretory. If you hit <kbd>Tab</kbd> once you will
likely see nothing change, as there are more than one possible options. Hitting <kbd>Tab</kbd>
a second time will print all possible autocomplete options.

So now let complete the relative path to your personal directory in this `cd` command:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cd resbaz2021/<username>
```
{: .language-bash}

Check that we've moved to the right place by running `pwd`.

## Create a text file

Now let's create a file. To do this we will use a text editor called Nano to create a file called `draft.txt`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} nano draft.txt
```
{: .language-bash}

> ## Which Editor?
>
> When we say, '`nano` is a text editor' we really do mean 'text': it can
> only work with plain character data, not tables, images, or any other
> human-friendly media. We use it in examples because it is one of the
> least complex text editors. However, because of this trait, it may
> not be powerful enough or flexible enough for the work you need to do
> after this workshop. On Unix systems (such as Linux and macOS),
> many programmers use [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) or
> [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) (both of which require more time to learn),
> or a graphical editor such as
> [Gedit](http://projects.gnome.org/gedit/). On Windows, you may wish to
> use [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/).  Windows also has a built-in
> editor called `notepad` that can be run from the command line in the same
> way as `nano` for the purposes of this lesson.
>
> No matter what editor you use, you will need to know where it searches
> for and saves files. If you start it from the shell, it will (probably)
> use your current working directory as its default location. If you use
> your computer's start menu, it may want to save files in your desktop or
> documents directory instead. You can change this by navigating to
> another directory the first time you 'Save As...'
{: .callout}

Let's type in a few lines of text.
Once we're happy with our text, we can press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
(press the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> or <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while
holding it down, press the <kbd>O</kbd> key) to write our data to disk
(we'll be asked what file we want to save this to:
press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`).

<div style="width:80%; margin: auto;"><img alt="screenshot of nano text editor in action"
src="../fig/nano-screenshot.png"></div>

Once our file is saved, we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to quit the editor and
return to the shell.

> ## Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key
>
> The Control key is also called the 'Ctrl' key. There are various ways
> in which using the Control key may be described. For example, you may
> see an instruction to press the <kbd>Control</kbd> key and, while holding it down,

> * `Control+X`
> * `Ctrl-X`
> * `Ctrl+X`
> * `^X`
> * `C-x`
>
> In nano, along the bottom of the screen you'll see `^G Get Help ^O WriteOut`.
> This means that you can use `Control-G` to get help and `Control-O` to save your
> file.
{: .callout}

`nano` doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` now shows that we have created a file called `draft.txt`:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}

```
draft.txt
```
{: .output}

## Copying files and directories

In a future lesson, we will be running the R script ```/nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021/array_sum.r```, but as we can't all work on the same file at once you will need to take your own copy. This can be done with the **c**o**p**y command `cp`, two arguments are needed the file (or directory) you want to copy, and the directory (or file) where you want the copy to be created. We will be copying the file into the directory we made previously, as this should be your current directory the second argument can be a simple `.`.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} cp /nesi/project/nesi99991/resbaz2021/array_sum.sh .
```

We can check that it did the right thing using `ls`

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} ls
```
{: .language-bash}

```
draft.txt   array_sum.r
```
{: .output}

We can also copy a directory and all its contents by using the
[recursive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion) option `-r`,
e.g. to back up a directory:

Alternatively, if in the future you wish to move a file, rather than copy it, you can replace the `cp` command with `mv`.
If you wish to permanently delete a file or directory you can use the `rm` command, but be careful, as once the file or directory is deleted it cannot be recovered.

## Getting help

Commands will often have many **options**. You can use the `man` (manual) command on most other commands to bring up the manual page of that command providing you with all the available options and their use. For example, for thr `ls` command:

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} man ls
```

Usage: ls [OPTION]... [FILE]...
List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default).
Sort entries alphabetically if neither -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options, too.
  -a, --all                  do not ignore entries starting with .
  -A, --almost-all           do not list implied . and ..
      --author               with -l, print the author of each file
  -b, --escape               print C-style escapes for nongraphic characters
      --block-size=SIZE      scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g.,
                               '--block-size=M' prints sizes in units of
                               1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below
  -B, --ignore-backups       do not list implied entries ending with ~
  -c                         with -lt: sort by, and show, ctime (time of last
                               modification of file status information);
                               with -l: show ctime and sort by name;
                               otherwise: sort by ctime, newest first
  -C                         list entries by columns
      --color[=WHEN]         colorize the output; WHEN can be 'always' (default
                               if omitted), 'auto', or 'never'; more info below
  -d, --directory            list directories themselves, not their contents
  -D, --dired                generate output designed for Emacs' dired mode
  -f                         do not sort, enable -aU, disable -ls --color
  -F, --classify             append indicator (one of */=>@|) to entries

To navigate through the `man` pages,
you may use <kbd>â†‘</kbd> and <kbd>â†“</kbd> to move line-by-line,
or try <kbd>B</kbd> and <kbd>Spacebar</kbd> to skip up and down by a full page.
To search for a character or word in the `man` pages,
use <kbd>/</kbd> followed by the character or word you are searching for.
Sometimes a search will result in multiple hits. If so, you can move between hits using <kbd>N</kbd> (for moving forward) and <kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>N</kbd> (for moving backward).

To **quit** the `man` pages, press <kbd>Q</kbd>.
