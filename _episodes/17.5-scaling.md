The aim of these tests will be to establish how a jobs requirements change with size (CPUs, inputs) and ultimately figure out the best way to run your jobs.

Unfortunately we cannot assume speedup will be linear (e.g. double CPUs won't usually half runtime, doubling the size of your input data won't necessarily double runtime) therefore more testing is required. This is called *scaling testing*.

## Scaling Test

Last time we submitted a job, we did not specify a number of CPUs, and therefore got the default of `2` (1 'core').

As a reminder, our slurm script `example-job.sl` should currently look like this.

```
{% include example-job.sl.1 %}
```
{: .language-bash}


Using the information we collected from the previous job (`nn_seff <job-id>`), we will submit the same job again with more CPUs and our best estimates of required resources.
We ask for more CPUs using by adding `#SBATCH --cpus-per-task 4` to our script.

> ## acctg-freq

> We will also add the line `#SBATCH --acctg-freq 1`.
> By default SLURM records job data every 30 seconds. This means any job running for less than 30 
> seconds will not have it's memory use recorded.
> You will not usually need to change this value, we are only doing so here because our test jobs are so short.
>
{: .callout}

[//]: # Remove acctg-freq

Your script should now look like this:

```
{% include example-job.sl.2 %}
```
{: .language-bash}

And then submit using `sbatch` as we did before.

```
{{ site.remote.prompt }} sbatch example-job.sl
```
{: .language-bash}

{% include {{ site.snippets }}/scheduler/basic-job-script.snip %}

> ## Watch
>
> We can prepend any command with `watch` in order to continuously it. e.g. `watch squeue --me` will 
> give us up to date information on our running jobs.
{: .callout}

Checking on our job with `sacct`.
Oh no! 
{% include {{ site.snippets }}/resources/OOM.snip %}

> ## OOM Error
> 
> 1. What went wrong?
> 2. What should be our next steps? 
> 3. How can we avoid this happening again in the future.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > The job failed due to an out of "OUT_OF_ME+(MORY)" error. This is because we doubled the number of 
> > CPUs over our previous job, but did not adjust memory.
> > The job running on 2 CPUs used â‰ˆ 200Mb of RAM, extrapolating linearly, we want to give a 4 CPU job 400 Mb + small buffer, say 500Mb to be safe.
> > 
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

In order to establish an understanding of the scaling properties we may have to repeat this test several times, giving more resources each iteration.
> ## Scaling Exercise
>
> * Find your name in the [spreadsheet]({{ site.exersice }}) and modify `example-job.sl` to request 
> "x" cpus-per-task.
> * Make an estimate memory requirement based on our previous runs. 
> * Submit the job with `sbatch example-job.sl`. 
> * Watch the job with `squeue --me`.
> * On completion of job, use `nn_seff <job-id>` and enter in details in spreadsheet.

## Scaling Behavior

### Diminishing Returns

Running code in parallel rarely comes for free, there are usually computational overheads. 
Whatever method is being used to distrubute the workload usually require some computation, as well as comunication between proccesses.

![Fraction of CPU doing useful computation decreases due to overheads.](../fig/DimReturns.svg)

This usually leads to diminishing returns when it comes to performance.

### Amdahl's Law

Most computational tasks will have a certain amount of work that must be computed serially.

![The blue components can be run in parallel, red cannot.](../fig/AmdahlsLaw.svg)

As only the parallel portion of the job is sped up by scaling, the ratio of parallel to serial is an important factor in job scaling. 

![Larger fractions of parallel code will have closer to linear scaling performance.](../fig/AmdahlsLaw2.svg)

Eventually your performance gains will plateau.

The fraction of the task that can be run in parallel determines the point of this plateau.
Code that has no serial components is said to be "embarrassingly parallel".
