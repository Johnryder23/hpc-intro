In a web browser, navigate to [https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz), select the resource requirements *for your job*. Jobs are run interactively.  

**Best For:** New Users, Job and code tests and Jobs using < 4 CPUs and < 128GB

**Advantages:** Interactive, file explorer, no local setup required.

### Jupyter and SBATCH


![Terminal](/fig/UsingJupyterHub3.svg)
In a web browser, navigate to [https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz](https://jupyter.nesi.org.nz), select the resource requirements *for your session* (should only need minimal memory and CPU).  Jobs scripts are submitted using the `sbatch` command (non-interactive).  

**Best For:** New Users, Windows Users.  

**Advantages:** File explorer, no local setup required.

### SSH and SBATCH
